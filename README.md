# AI Quota Bar

A macOS menu bar application for monitoring model coding plan quota across providers.

AI Quota Bar is focused on coding-plan consumption: it tracks the remaining quota for supported AI coding models, shows per-model breakdowns, and warns you before a short-interval or subscription quota runs out. It currently supports MiniMax, GLM/Z.ai, and Codex coding quota snapshots.

## Features

- Menu bar widget displaying remaining coding-plan quota
- Detailed per-provider and per-model usage breakdown
- Quota trend charts for short-interval model limits
- Automatic menu bar fallback to the used model with the soonest reset when the displayed quota expires
- Right-click menu bar shortcut for cycling through used short-interval models
- Configurable refresh interval
- Warning notifications when quota runs low
- Secure provider credential storage via Keychain
- Optional cloud backup of quota snapshots through your own Cloudflare Worker + D1 database

## Requirements

- macOS 14+
- MiniMax API key, GLM quota curl command, Codex CLI installed and signed in (`codex` command available), or any combination of them

## Build & Run

```bash
make build
make run
```

## License

## Install

```bash
make install
```

## Configuration

1. Click the menu bar icon
2. Select **Settings**
3. Enter a MiniMax API key, paste a GLM quota curl command, sign in to Codex via the `codex` CLI, or configure multiple providers
4. Configured providers refresh together and appear as separate sections in the menu
5. Adjust refresh interval as needed

## Menu bar behavior

The menu bar item shows one primary quota at a time. When the displayed model is exhausted or its reset window has already passed, AI Quota Bar automatically falls back to the eligible model whose reset time arrives soonest. Models that are still at full quota are skipped when there is already-used quota to show, so the menu bar stays focused on active limits.

Left-click the menu bar item to open the detailed dropdown. Right-click it to quickly cycle through used short-interval models, which are the models shown with trend charts in the dropdown rather than long-window progress bars.

## MiniMax support

For MiniMax, paste the bearer token used by the MiniMax coding plan remains endpoint. The app calls the MiniMax coding plan quota API and maps the returned model quota windows into the menu bar and dropdown views.

## GLM support

For GLM/Z.ai, the quota API is tied to your signed-in web session. You need to copy the request from the official website yourself:

1. Sign in to the official BigModel/Z.ai website in your browser.
2. Open the coding plan or quota page where your model quota is displayed.
3. Open the browser developer tools.
4. Refresh the quota page or trigger the quota query again.
5. In the Network panel, find the `quota/limit` request.
6. Copy that request as a curl command.
7. Paste the full curl command into AI Quota Bar Settings.

The app parses the endpoint URL, `authorization`, `bigmodel-organization`, `bigmodel-project`, and cookie fields, then stores the parsed credential in Keychain.

GLM quota fields are mapped differently from MiniMax:

- `currentValue` means used amount.
- `usage` means total amount.
- Remaining amount is calculated as `usage - currentValue`.
- `TOKENS_LIMIT` is shown as `GLM Tokens (5h)`.
- `TIME_LIMIT` is shown as `GLM MCP/Search (month)`.

Because the GLM credential comes from your browser session, it may expire. If GLM refresh fails after a while, repeat the steps above and paste a fresh curl command.

## Codex support

Codex quota is fetched by reusing the [`codexbar`](https://github.com/steipete/CodexBar) project as a local SwiftPM dependency (`CodexBarCore`). AI Quota Bar does not talk to ChatGPT/OpenAI endpoints directly; instead it wraps codexbar's `ProviderDescriptor` and lets codexbar choose the best available source:

- `primary_window` is shown as `5h`, with remaining quota displayed as a percentage and reset shown as a time.
- `secondary_window` is shown as `Weekly`, with remaining quota displayed as a percentage and reset shown as a date.
- Extra rate-limit windows returned by codexbar (for example the Codex CLI's secondary counters) are mapped to additional rows in the dropdown.
- `Credits` balance is shown when codexbar reports it.
- Plan details such as Plus or Pro are shown when returned by the response.
- Multiple Codex accounts can be configured and displayed separately, each with its own account header in the dropdown.

The Codex section in Settings exposes a **Source mode** picker that matches codexbar's `ProviderSourceMode`:

- `Auto` — try OAuth, then the local `codex` CLI, then the OpenAI web session, in that order.
- `OAuth` — only use the local Codex CLI's OAuth credentials.
- `CLI` — only use the `~/.codex` and `~/.codexbar` config directories read by the CLI.
- `Web` — only use the OpenAI web session scraped through the local browser cookie store.

To add a Codex account, sign in through the official `codex` CLI once on this Mac:

```bash
codex        # follow the OAuth / sign-in prompt
```

AI Quota Bar reads the same `~/.codex` directory the CLI writes to, so no extra paste-in step is required. New accounts are picked up automatically by the **Refresh** action in Settings; the **Sign out** button clears the local Codex credentials through codexbar's managed account store. The **Remove** button only hides the account from AI Quota Bar's list without touching the underlying CLI credentials.

The pre-2.0 single-account ChatGPT/Codex GPT flow (paste session JSON or curl) has been removed. Existing stored credentials are not migrated; please re-connect through the `codex` CLI after upgrading.

## Cloud backup

AI Quota Bar can back up quota snapshots to a Cloudflare D1 database through a small Worker in `cloudflare/`.
Provider credentials are not uploaded; MiniMax and GLM credentials remain in macOS Keychain, and Codex accounts live in codexbar's managed account store under `~/.codexbar`.

See `cloudflare/README.md` for the Cloudflare setup steps, then paste the deployed Worker URL and sync token into Settings.
After setup, use **Settings -> Cloud backup -> View remote data** to open a local HTML report of the remote D1 data. The fallback command is `cloudflare/view-remote-data.command`.

## Release highlights

### 2.0.0

- Rewrote the Codex/ChatGPT provider on top of the `codexbar` project's `CodexBarCore` library.
- Replaced the pasted session-JSON / curl setup with `codex` CLI sign-in and codexbar's managed account store.
- Added a Source mode picker (Auto / OAuth / CLI / Web) and multi-account support that mirrors codexbar.
- Mapped the Codex rate-limit windows (`5h` and `Weekly`) plus the credits balance into the menu and dropdown, grouped by account.

- Added a Settings shortcut to view remote stored quota data as a local HTML report.
- Kept provider credentials local in Keychain while storing only compact quota history remotely.
- Added launch-at-login preferences and improved model grouping for exhausted/full quota rows.

- Skipped full, unused quota windows during active-model cycling.
- Added README coverage for multi-account ChatGPT setup introduced after 1.3.0.

### 1.3.1
